<h2><i>Publications</i></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I regret to say that, up until now, I have not had any formal academic publications. However, I am optimistic about the future and look forward to making significant contributions to the advancement of academic knowledge through my future publications. I am dedicated to deepening my research and sharing valuable insights with the academic community.</p>

<h2><i>Working Papers</i></h2>

<p>Over the past two years, I have not achieved any academic outcomes worth mentioning below. The work I have done has been merely the most basic tasks, far removed from true economics. In the initial stages, I received incorrect academic training, which set me far from the path to top-tier research. When I realized this and started anew, as you know, it took time and required confidence. Sometimes, I felt very discouraged, but every time I encountered Professors <i>Zhen Song, Junjian Yi, Ruixue Jia</i>, it seemed that everything else became insignificant, and all difficulties could be overcome. I believe in myself, but I need time.</p>
