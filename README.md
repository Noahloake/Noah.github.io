**Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics, Guanghua School of Management, Peking University**

I received dual Bachelor's degrees in Management and Economics from Wuhan University of Technology and Wuhan University in Jul 2020. I earned my M.S. in Theoretical Economics from Renmin University of China in Aug 2023, under the supervision of Professors Ran Tao and Shouying Liu. Since 2023, I have been pursuing my Ph.D. in Applied Economics at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University.

My research interests include macro-finance, new political economy, and macro-development economics. I am particularly focused on the role of local governments and bureaucratic systems in the allocation of financial resources in China.
